This repository gathers "context" files to configure specialised Large Language Models (LLMs) units targeted at assisting users with Kiara-related formatting tasks, such as formatting Python code into Kiara modules and pipelines.

We use the term "context" to designate files that contain model-agnostic documentation created for LLMs' configuration purposes. Such context files aim to assist users in transforming Python workflows into reusable Kiara pipelines.
